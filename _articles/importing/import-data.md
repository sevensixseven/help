**Personal Accounts**

To import your data, log into the web vault at <https://vault.bitwarden.com> and navigate to **Tools** &rarr; **Import Data**. Instructions for importing from each source are available after selecting the desired file format from the dropdown menu.

**Organization Accounts**

You can also import data directly into an organization account for sharing. To import your data, log into the web vault at <https://vault.bitwarden.com> and navigate to your organization admin area. Then navigate to **Tools** &rarr; **Import Data**. Instructions for importing from each source are available after selecting the desired file format from the dropdown menu.

## Generic CSV Format (individual account)

You can manually condition a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file for your individual account import using the generic Bitwarden format. Create a UTF-8 encoded plaintext file with the following format:

```
folder,favorite,type,name,notes,fields,login_uri,login_username,login_password,login_totp
```

The above header must be the first line in the file. An example file may look like the following:

```
folder,favorite,type,name,notes,fields,login_uri,login_username,login_password,login_totp
Social,1,login,Twitter,,,twitter.com,me@example.com,password123,
,,login,EVGA,,,https://www.evga.com/support/login.asp,hello@bitwarden.com,fakepassword,TOTPSEED123
,,login,My Bank,Bank PIN is 1234,"PIN: 1234",https://www.wellsfargo.com/home.jhtml,john.smith,password123456,
,,note,My Note,"This is a secure note.",,,,,
```

When importing from this format, select the **Bitwarden (csv)** file format option from the dropdown menu.

## Generic CSV Format (organization account)

You can manually condition a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file for your organization account import using the generic Bitwarden format. The format is almost the same as the individual account format above, however, organizations have "collections" instead of a "folder" and no "favorite". Create a UTF-8 encoded plaintext file with the following format:

```
collections,type,name,notes,fields,login_uri,login_username,login_password,login_totp
```

The above header must be the first line in the file. An example file may look like the following:

```
collections,type,name,notes,fields,login_uri,login_username,login_password,login_totp
"Social,Marketing",login,Twitter,,,twitter.com,me@example.com,password123,
"Finance",login,My Bank,Bank PIN is 1234,"PIN: 1234",https://www.wellsfargo.com/home.jhtml,john.smith,password123456,
,login,EVGA,,,https://www.evga.com/support/login.asp,hello@bitwarden.com,fakepassword,TOTPSEED123
,note,My Note,"This is a secure note.",,,,,
```

When importing from this format, select the **Bitwarden (csv)** file format option from the dropdown menu.

## Troubleshooting Import Errors

<u>Ciphers[<b>X</b>].Login: The field <b>yyyy</b> exceeds the maximum encrypted value length of <b>zzzz</b> characters.</u>

This error occurs whenever an item in your exported file has a large amount of data associated with it, which exceeds the limits allowed for items stored in your Bitwarden vault. You will need to correct this data by removing it, or reducing its size so that the Bitwarden importer will succeed.

You can open the exported file in a text editor or spreadsheet program (such as Excel) to locate it. The offending item can be found at index **X** (as referenced in the error message) in the file. Once you have located the offending item, remove it or update its data, then resave and try the import operation with Bitwarden again.
