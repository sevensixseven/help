4. **Name** your application "Bitwarden"
5. Set the **Application type** to "Web app / API" 
6. Set the **Sign-on URL** to any website value, such as "https://company.com". This URL is not used in this setup process so it can be anything.
7. Click the **Create** button to create the application.

## Grant Application Permissions

1. Select the **Bitwarden** application you created in the previous section.
2. Navigate to **Settings** and select **Required Permissions**.
3. Delete the existing **Windows Azure Active Directory** API permission set that is automatically created by default. It is not needed.
5. Select the **Add** button to create a new API permission set.
6. For step 1, **Select an API** for **Microsoft Graph**.
7. For step 2, **Select Permissions** for the following:
   - Application Permissions:
     - "Read all users' full profiles"
     - "Read all groups"
   - Delegated Permissions:
     - "Read all groups"
     - "Read all users' full profiles"
     - "Read all users basic profiles"
8. Click the **Select** button and then **Done** to add the Microsoft Graph API permissions.

## Create Application Secret Key

1. Go back to the **Bitwarden** application that you created.
2. Navigate to **Settings** and select **Keys**.
3. Add a new **Password** key by entering a **Name** and **Duration**. We recommend selecting "Never Expires" for the duration.
4. Click **Save** to create a new secret key.
5. Copy the key's value to safe place. We will need to reference it later.

## Get Your Application ID

1. Go back to the **Bitwarden** application that you created.
2. Copy the **Application ID** to a safe place.  We will need to reference it later.

## Get Your Tenant Hostname

1. Select the **Directory and Subscription** filter in the top right corner of the Azure Portal.
2. Note the **hostname** value that appears under your directory (ex. company.onmicrosoft.com). This is your **Tenant** hostname. Copy the **Tenant** hostname to a safe place. We will need to reference it later.

## Configure Directory Connector

1. Launch the Directory Connector desktop application.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Select **Azure Active Directory** as the directory type.
6. Enter the **Tenant** hostname that you copied from the steps above (ex. company.onmicrosoft.com).
7. Enter the **Application ID** that you copied from the steps above.
8. Enter the Application **Secret** Key that you copied from the steps above.

Congrats! You are done configuring Azure Active Directory with the Bitwarden Directory Connector.

## Testing

{% note %}
It can take up to 15 minutes for the granted permissions for your application to properly propagate. You may receive "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation" errors in the meantime.
{% endnote %}

Test your configuration by running a sync test. You should see your Azure Active Directory groups and/or users printed to the screen.
